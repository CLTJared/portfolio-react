      <p>Let's get to know each other a bit more.</p>
      <p>
        A little about me. I have a 14 year old daughter and a 5 year old Shiba Inu, named Nacho!
        I started my journey with web design & development back in 2004 with an Associates degree. At the time, I enjoyed working with the LAMP stack and
        coming up with unique solutions to problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Career-wise, I decided to take my journey towards the IT Support side of things, but have found a renewed passion in wanting to learn new development and look into the career path I once pursued.
